# Planner/reviewer handoff

This is the current decision checkpoint, not a delivery ledger or approval log.
Read [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) for the standing review and publication rules,
[current-work.md](current-work.md) for delivery facts, and the
[roadmap](mvp-delivery-plan.md) and accepted [ADRs](../decisions/README.md)
for product and architecture decisions. Verify this checkpoint against Git and
code before relying on it; older decision detail remains in Git.

## Current decision (2026-09-27)

- Codex owns planning, architecture, slice selection, review, and acceptance;
  Claude is the bounded executor. Routine slice selection needs no owner
  approval; committing and pushing an executor diff still requires Codex GO.
- The configured Claude Implementer session-persistence slice was accepted
  after two correction rounds and published as `1d9f6b4876b43b0585ed8422d4de653966e8e8dc`.
  Codex independently passed API 307/307, focused Application 8/8, focused
  frontend 19/19, typecheck, and diff check before GO. The remote was verified;
  broader executor-reported checks are in the shared handoff. This does not
  close Increment 4.
- No next execution slice is selected. Investigate remaining Increment 4
  runtime controls against code, accepted ADRs, and provider contracts first.
  The configured session-persistence fact does not imply resumability.
- Provider account-allowance evidence remains closed without delivery: neither
  local CLI offered a proven safe, authoritative, machine-readable observation
  contract. Do not add `Unknown`-only scaffolding or direct authenticated API
  access without a new accepted decision.
