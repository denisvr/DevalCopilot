# Agent collaboration provider contracts

This companion to the [agent collaboration protocol](agent-collaboration-protocol.md)
holds the provider CLI safety contracts formerly under its
[provider runtime configuration](agent-collaboration-protocol.md#provider-runtime-configuration),
which retains host runtime preflight and forwards extracted subjects through
their original headings.
The sections below are moved verbatim; the protocol's original headings forward
here. The implementation contract builds on the critical-review contract that
precedes it, so its references to that contract "above" mean the preceding
section. Mapping: [protocol rework map](../roadmap/agent-collaboration-protocol-rework-map.md).

## Claude Code critical-review CLI safety contract

The installed `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` package (version `2.1.276` at the time this contract
was evidenced) ships a native `claude.exe` as its declared `bin` entry — a `DirectExecutable`
launch target, never a Node-hosted script. Every fact below was proven from authoritative local
evidence only (`claude --version`, `claude --help`, the package's own `package.json` and bundled
`cli-wrapper.cjs`, and embedded literal strings in the compiled binary) — never by invoking a real
authenticated model to discover a flag. A Claude critical-review attempt invokes this exact,
fixed argument list, with the context manifest delivered over stdin and no argument ever
containing prompt text, repository content, or a credential:

```
--print
--input-format text
--output-format json
--json-schema <inline JSON Schema for the Acceptance/Challenge union>
--safe-mode
--restricted
--disable-slash-commands
--no-chrome
--permission-prompts none
--prompt-suggestions false
--tools ""
--strict-mcp-config
--permission-mode plan
--no-session-persistence
--session-id <fresh random GUID>
--max-turns 1
```

- **Non-interactive**: `--print` runs one bounded turn and exits; it is never given a TTY.
- **Stdin, never argv**: `--input-format text` (the default) reads the prompt/context from
  stdin; the CLI's own embedded strings confirm a bounded stdin-wait and UTF-8 stdin handling.
- **Structured output**: `--output-format json` wraps the result in one JSON envelope on stdout
  (fields observed in the binary's own string table: `is_error`, `result`, `session_id`,
  `subtype`, `num_turns`, `total_cost_usd`, `duration_ms`); `--json-schema` constrains the
  provider's own `result` field to this slice's fixed Acceptance/Challenge schema. Unlike Codex,
  Claude's print mode has no file-based final-response flag — the adapter extracts `result` from
  this envelope and writes it to the same sealed final-response artifact Codex's CLI writes
  directly, so every later parsing/recording step is identical between both providers.
- **Fully isolated from local customizations and indirect execution**: `--tools ""` and
  `--strict-mcp-config` alone disable built-in tools and non-declared MCP servers, but the
  installed CLI's own `--help` proves neither one disables hooks, plugins, skills, CLAUDE.md
  auto-discovery, Claude-in-Chrome, or user/project/local settings files — a `SessionStart` hook
  or a project-local setting could otherwise still cause a command to run with no built-in tool
  ever invoked. `--safe-mode` disables CLAUDE.md, skills, plugins, hooks, MCP servers, custom
  commands/agents, output styles, workflows, themes, and keybindings outright; `--restricted`
  independently removes command/code-running tools and WebFetch and ignores user/project/local
  settings files (a second, independent path to the same guarantee); `--disable-slash-commands`
  disables all skills; `--no-chrome` disables the Claude-in-Chrome integration entirely;
  `--permission-prompts none` denies anything that would otherwise prompt, independent of the
  permission mode; and `--permission-mode plan` is the strongest available permission mode — it
  never executes an action, only plans one, even if every tool were somehow still reachable.
  `--prompt-suggestions false` suppresses the provider's own predicted-next-prompt side output.
  `--bare` is deliberately never passed: the installed version's own `--help` states it changes
  the authentication contract itself (Anthropic auth becomes strictly
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`/`apiKeyHelper`; OAuth and keychain are never read), which would silently
  break this slice's reliance on existing local CLI authentication.
- **No session resume**: `--no-session-persistence` plus a fresh, per-attempt random
  `--session-id` guarantee this invocation can never continue or fork an unrelated prior session;
  `--continue`, `--resume`, and `--fork-session` are never passed.
- **Bounded turns**: `--max-turns 1` bounds the agentic loop to a single turn; `--max-turns` was
  confirmed present in the compiled binary's embedded string table (alongside a corroborating
  `error_max_turns` result subtype) even though it is not listed in the CLI's own abbreviated
  `--help` output.
- **Cancellation and process-tree compatibility**: proven generically by the same process-tree
  termination infrastructure already established for Codex — a `DirectExecutable` launch target
  is handled identically regardless of which provider resolved to it.

The stdout envelope itself is also validated, not merely parsed: `is_error` must be present and a
genuine JSON boolean (only a literal `false` is ever treated as success — a missing or
non-boolean value fails the whole envelope closed), `result` must be present, and a present
`session_id` must be a well-shaped bounded string (a genuine JSON `null` is tolerated exactly like
an absent field, since `--no-session-persistence` means the provider may legitimately have no
session to report; anything else malformed rejects the whole envelope, never just that field, on
the reasoning that a provider which cannot even shape its own bookkeeping field correctly is not
a source whose `result` should be trusted either).

One material limitation, honestly disclosed rather than assumed away: the exact shape of the
`result` field when `--json-schema` is supplied (a JSON string containing schema-conformant text,
versus the schema-conformant JSON value directly) was inferred from embedded evidence and general
knowledge of the CLI's public contract, not observed from a real authenticated invocation — the
adapter therefore normalizes either shape defensively, and the downstream parser fails closed
(`InvalidStructuredOutput`, never a false Acceptance) if that inference is ever wrong.

## Claude Code implementation CLI safety contract

The Claude implementation attempt invokes the same installed `claude.exe` `DirectExecutable`
launch target as the critical-review attempt above, using a dedicated argument list — never the
critical-review adapter reused by changing flags, since this role's tool allowlist and permission
mode differ in kind (mutating repository edits) from every other Claude usage in this protocol.
The context manifest is delivered over stdin exactly as above:

```
--print
--input-format text
--output-format json
--json-schema <inline JSON Schema for the implementation report>
--safe-mode
--restricted
--disable-slash-commands
--no-chrome
--permission-prompts none
--prompt-suggestions false
--tools "Read,Edit,Write,Glob,Grep"
--strict-mcp-config
--permission-mode acceptEdits
--no-session-persistence
--session-id <fresh random GUID>
```

Every hardening flag shared with the critical-review contract above (`--safe-mode`,
`--restricted`, `--disable-slash-commands`, `--no-chrome`, `--permission-prompts none`,
`--prompt-suggestions false`, `--strict-mcp-config`, `--no-session-persistence`, and the same
never-`--bare`/`--continue`/`--resume`/`--fork-session`/`--dangerously-skip-permissions` set)
applies identically. Two differences are deliberate:

- **An explicit tool allowlist, not the empty one**: `--tools "Read,Edit,Write,Glob,Grep"` grants
  only file-reading and file-editing tools. The installed CLI's own `--help` states this option
  supplies "the list of available tools" — never "additional" tools, the wording `--add-dir` uses
  for its own genuinely additive option — and its three parallel forms (`""` disables all tools,
  `"default"` restores every tool, an explicit list names exactly the available set) are only
  coherent under replacement semantics: `""` could not mean "no tools" if a passed list were
  merely added to an existing default set. The compiled binary's own embedded implementation
  corroborates this: the CLI computes a `baseToolsCli`/`getAllBaseTools` tool universe distinct
  from the separate `allowedToolsCli`/`disallowedToolsCli` permission-grant layer used by the
  unrelated `--allowedTools`/`--disallowedTools` flags this adapter never passes, and applies it
  through a coordinator tool filter (`applyCoordinatorToolFilter`). Every name in the allowlist —
  and every name deliberately absent from it (Bash, WebFetch, WebSearch, NotebookEdit, Task/Agent,
  ExitPlanMode) — is confirmed present as a literal, capitalized tool identifier in the installed
  CLI binary: this attempt never runs a shell, script, or arbitrary process, never browses the
  web, and never spawns a sub-agent. `--restricted`'s own `--help` text independently confirms
  Bash/PowerShell/REPL/code-running tools and WebFetch are removed "unless `--tools` names them"
  (this allowlist never does) and that it "confines the file tools to the working directories". No
  Git command, verification command, commit, push, package install, or network operation is ever
  reachable through this allowlist.
- **`--permission-mode acceptEdits`, not `plan`**: the strongest available mode still compatible
  with real file mutation, since `plan` never edits anything and `bypassPermissions` is explicitly
  refused by `--restricted`. Beyond the enum name and the corroborating embedded string
  "auto-accept edits", the compiled binary contains an actual `realpathSync`-backed, cached
  path-resolution utility (`realpathSync(path) { val = lazyFs().realpathSync(path); }`) together
  with a `blockReadsOutsideWorkingDirectories` permission concept and a `checkPathSafetyForAutoEdit`
  function named specifically for this mode's own auto-applied-edit path — real implementation
  evidence, not merely a flag description, that edits accepted under this mode are checked against
  a working-directory boundary using symlink/junction-resolving real-path comparison, consistent
  with `--restricted`'s own textual confinement guarantee above. The one point that remains a
  disclosed inference rather than a directly observed behavior is the mode's precise interactive
  consequence (that it truly never blocks on a prompt for an in-boundary edit) — the CLI ships no
  bundled documentation asserting this in so many words, and confirming it further would require
  an authenticated invocation this project's evidence discipline forbids. Mirrors the
  `result`-field-shape limitation the critical-review contract above already discloses in kind.
- **No `--max-turns` by default; an optional owner request adds exactly one**: implementation is
  inherently multi-step (read, edit, re-read), unlike a single-turn critical review, so no turn
  limit is passed unless the attempt's immutable snapshot requested one (see
  ["Optional Claude agentic-turn limit for mutation attempts"](agent-collaboration-protocol.md#optional-claude-agentic-turn-limit-for-mutation-attempts));
  otherwise the bound remains the process-level timeout, cancellation, and process-tree
  termination already established for every other provider adapter.

Because each initial Implementer invocation can genuinely mutate the worktree, the
orchestrator always independently re-reads fresh Git evidence after this adapter returns —
regardless of whether the process succeeded, failed, or threw — and never assumes a failed or
cancelled process left the worktree untouched.

## Deferred Gemini CLI execution boundary

Gemini CLI 0.60.0 is not currently selectable or claimable. Its system settings
are administrative configuration that require trusted administrator ownership
and permissions. DevalCopilot must never manufacture that policy in
user-owned attempt scratch state. A future slice must define trusted
installation and policy provisioning, ACL validation, exact semantic policy
validation, readiness reporting, and a real no-model contract test before any
Gemini execution can be enabled.

Gemini authentication material must not be copied into scratch or persistence.
No automatic fallback or parallel execution is authorized. Durable assignment
facts do not authorize automatic verification or publication.
