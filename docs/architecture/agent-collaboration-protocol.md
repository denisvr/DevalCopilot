# Agent collaboration protocol

## Purpose

The protocol enables constructive disagreement and evidence-based resolution
without creating an unbounded free-form conversation. It separates durable
workflow semantics from provider-specific session formats.

Codex and Claude Code have primary roles, not absolute authority. The
orchestrator owns authority and enforces the resolved plan, policies, budgets,
and gates.

## Message envelope

Every accepted agent message maps to a project-owned envelope:

```json
{
  "protocolVersion": "1.0",
  "messageId": "msg_01...",
  "runId": "run_01...",
  "taskId": "task_01...",
  "attemptId": "attempt_01...",
  "sender": "codex",
  "recipient": "claude",
  "type": "challenge",
  "inReplyTo": "msg_01...",
  "summary": "The proposed transaction boundary includes a long-running process.",
  "content": "Persist intent before launching the process.",
  "evidenceRefs": ["artifact_01..."],
  "suggestedActions": ["revise-plan"],
  "createdAtUtc": "2026-09-11T12:00:00Z"
}
```

Provider session identifiers and raw response locations are metadata on the
attempt. They do not replace the project envelope.

## Message types

### Proposal

Introduces a plan, design, implementation approach, or corrective action. A
proposal states assumptions, affected areas, verification, and known risks.

### Acceptance

Confirms that a proposal is feasible and consistent. Acceptance must include a
short rationale; passive agreement without evaluation is not sufficient.

### Challenge

Disputes a concrete claim, assumption, omission, sequence, or approach. A valid
challenge contains:

- the disputed item;
- impact if left unresolved;
- reasoning or evidence;
- a proposed alternative or a precise question.

Contrarian language without a material consequence is not a challenge.

### Question

Requests information required to continue. It identifies why the answer
changes the work. Questions that require product authority are escalated to the
human rather than guessed.

### Decision

Resolves one or more proposals or challenges as `Accepted`, `PartiallyAccepted`,
`Rejected`, or `Escalated`. It includes rationale, resulting plan changes, and
the exact next action.

### Execution report

Describes completed work and references the actual diff, commands, tests, and
artifacts. It does not assert success beyond the evidence.

### Review finding

Records severity, affected location, expected behavior, evidence, and required
disposition. Findings are stable records, not embedded only in prose.

### Revision response

Maps each finding to `Fixed`, `Disputed`, `Deferred`, or `NeedsHumanDecision`
with evidence and resulting source changes.

### Escalation

Summarizes the unresolved decision, available options, consequences, evidence,
and recommended choice. It contains no hidden default action.

## Default interaction

### Planning

Codex receives the objective, project context, baseline, relevant instructions,
and selected evidence. It returns a proposal with scope, sequence, risks,
verification, and escalation points.

### Critical review

Claude Code receives the objective and proposal before implementation. It must
return either:

- an acceptance with feasibility rationale; or
- one or more material challenges.

### Resolution

Codex resolves every challenge explicitly. A partially accepted or rejected
challenge must include reasoning. Changes become a new plan revision rather
than silently editing history.

### Execution and review

Claude Code implements only the resolved plan and records unexpected discoveries
as challenges or questions. Codex reviews the exact Git fingerprint and
verification evidence. Findings and responses remain linked across iterations.

## Authority matrix

| Action | Codex | Claude Code | Orchestrator | Human |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Propose or challenge a plan | Yes | Yes | Records | May intervene |
| Resolve technical challenge | Primary | May dispute | Enforces bounds | Final escalation authority |
| Modify source in executor stage | Read-only by default | Primary | Grants scoped workspace | May take over |
| Run configured local verification | Recommends | Recommends | Executes | May execute manually |
| Approve review | Primary | Responds | Validates evidence and state | May override explicitly |
| Commit | No direct authority | No direct authority | Executes after gate | Approves policy-sensitive cases |
| Push or create PR | No direct authority | No direct authority | Executes after gate | Approves in MVP |
| Merge, release, deploy | No | No | Not enabled in MVP | External/manual |

## Structured output failure

An adapter validates protocol version, type, identifiers, cardinality, text
limits, and referenced artifacts. Invalid output produces a failed attempt with
the raw response preserved. The system may request one bounded format repair,
but it never invents missing decisions, evidence, or success.

## Context assembly

Agent input is assembled from selected durable records:

- objective and current task;
- applicable project instructions;
- current plan revision and unresolved challenges;
- relevant decisions and findings;
- Git fingerprint and bounded diff summary;
- verification evidence and selected log excerpts;
- budgets, permissions, and expected response schema.

The complete historical transcript is not replayed by default. Raw transcripts
are artifacts available for inspection. Summaries carry source references so
the receiving agent can distinguish derived context from primary evidence.

## Token efficiency

- Build a context manifest for each attempt and include only inputs required by
  the current role and decision.
- Retrieve project documentation and source progressively instead of attaching
  the entire repository or documentation set.
- Reuse one durable summary of stable facts and link it to primary evidence;
  do not ask each agent to restate the same background.
- Send changed hunks, unresolved findings, and relevant neighboring code before
  considering a complete diff or file.
- Prefer deterministic tools for discovery, validation, counting, formatting,
  and status checks instead of spending model tokens inferring their results.
- Do not repeat an agent attempt unless state, instructions, evidence, or the
  expected response changed materially.
- Track input, output, and cached token usage when the provider exposes it.
- Stop and escalate when a stage budget is exhausted rather than silently
  borrowing unlimited tokens from the run.
- Select model capability and reasoning depth according to task risk, not as a
  universal maximum setting.

## Untrusted content

Repository files, comments, issue text, test output, CI logs, generated files,
and prior agent responses are quoted or delimited as untrusted evidence. They
cannot grant permissions, alter the protocol, request credentials, change
budgets, or bypass project instructions.

## Protocol evolution

The envelope is versioned. Additive optional fields may remain compatible.
Changing message meaning, authority, required fields, or resolution behavior
requires a protocol version and migration plan.
