# Agent collaboration protocol

## Purpose

The protocol enables constructive disagreement and evidence-based resolution
without creating an unbounded free-form conversation. It separates durable
workflow semantics from provider-specific session formats.

Codex and Claude Code have primary roles, not absolute authority. The
orchestrator owns authority and enforces the resolved plan, policies, budgets,
and gates.

## Message envelope

Every accepted agent message maps to a project-owned envelope:

```json
{
  "protocolVersion": "1.0",
  "messageId": "msg_01...",
  "runId": "run_01...",
  "taskId": "task_01...",
  "attemptId": "attempt_01...",
  "sender": "codex",
  "recipient": "claude",
  "type": "challenge",
  "inReplyTo": "msg_01...",
  "summary": "The proposed transaction boundary includes a long-running process.",
  "content": "Persist intent before launching the process.",
  "evidenceRefs": ["artifact_01..."],
  "suggestedActions": ["revise-plan"],
  "createdAtUtc": "2026-09-11T12:00:00Z"
}
```

Provider session identifiers and raw response locations are metadata on the
attempt. They do not replace the project envelope.

## Current durable ledger boundary

The current implementation persists a project-owned, append-only ledger of
validated `1.0` envelopes for one run, with an optional owning attempt and a
monotonic timeline sequence. It records bounded summaries and typed structured
details only; it does not persist a provider-native transcript, executable
path, environment value, credential, provider configuration, or raw output.
The deterministic walking-skeleton sequence writes envelopes marked
`Simulated`; this label is not evidence of provider observation, authentication,
or invocation.

Codex's Planning step is the first message type with a real, live provider
invocation: a durable Agent attempt records a bounded context manifest, runs
the Codex CLI as a real child process, and preserves its raw stdout, stderr,
and final-response content only as bounded sealed artifacts outside the
database — never as ledger or API content. A structurally valid Proposal is
still appended to the ledger only after passing the same protocol/schema
validation as any other message; an invalid, failed, or source-drifted
attempt appends none. Claude Code invocation, challenge resolution, and
review remain deferred: no message type beyond Codex's Proposal has a live
provider adapter yet, and every other envelope in the durable ledger is still
produced by the `Simulated` walking-skeleton sequence described above.

## Message types

### Proposal

Introduces a plan, design, implementation approach, or corrective action. A
proposal states assumptions, affected areas, verification, and known risks.

### Acceptance

Confirms that a proposal is feasible and consistent. Acceptance must include a
short rationale; passive agreement without evaluation is not sufficient.

### Challenge

Disputes a concrete claim, assumption, omission, sequence, or approach. A valid
challenge contains:

- the disputed item;
- impact if left unresolved;
- reasoning or evidence;
- a proposed alternative or a precise question.

Contrarian language without a material consequence is not a challenge.

### Question

Requests information required to continue. It identifies why the answer
changes the work. Questions that require product authority are escalated to the
human rather than guessed.

### Decision

Resolves one or more proposals or challenges as `Accepted`, `PartiallyAccepted`,
`Rejected`, or `Escalated`. It includes rationale, resulting plan changes, and
the exact next action.

### Execution report

Describes completed work and references the actual diff, commands, tests, and
artifacts. It does not assert success beyond the evidence.

### Review finding

Records severity, affected location, expected behavior, evidence, and required
disposition. Findings are stable records, not embedded only in prose.

### Revision response

Maps each finding to `Fixed`, `Disputed`, `Deferred`, or `NeedsHumanDecision`
with evidence and resulting source changes.

### Escalation

Summarizes the unresolved decision, available options, consequences, evidence,
and recommended choice. It contains no hidden default action.

## Version 1.0 reply semantics

The durable ledger validates each reply against this closed relationship table.
A proposal starts a thread and cannot reply. Every other message type must reply
to an earlier message in the same run.

| Message type | Allowed parent type |
|---|---|
| Acceptance, Challenge | Proposal |
| Decision | Proposal or Challenge |
| Execution report | Decision |
| Review finding | Execution report |
| Revision response | Review finding |
| Question | Proposal, Challenge, Decision, Execution report, or Review finding |
| Escalation | Proposal, Challenge, Decision, Execution report, Review finding, Revision response, or Question |

Question and escalation are therefore bounded by the fact that needs an answer
or cannot be resolved; neither starts an ungrounded side conversation.

## Default interaction

### Planning

Codex receives the objective, project context, baseline, relevant instructions,
and selected evidence. It returns a proposal with scope, sequence, risks,
verification, and escalation points.

### Critical review

Claude Code receives the objective and proposal before implementation. It must
return either:

- an acceptance with feasibility rationale; or
- one or more material challenges.

### Resolution

Codex resolves every challenge explicitly. A partially accepted or rejected
challenge must include reasoning. Changes become a new plan revision rather
than silently editing history.

### Execution and review

Claude Code implements only the resolved plan and records unexpected discoveries
as challenges or questions. Codex reviews the exact Git fingerprint and
verification evidence. Findings and responses remain linked across iterations.

## Authority matrix

| Action | Codex | Claude Code | Orchestrator | Human |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Propose or challenge a plan | Yes | Yes | Records | May intervene |
| Resolve technical challenge | Primary | May dispute | Enforces bounds | Final escalation authority |
| Modify source in executor stage | Read-only by default | Primary | Grants scoped workspace | May take over |
| Run configured local verification | Recommends | Recommends | Executes | May execute manually |
| Approve review | Primary | Responds | Validates evidence and state | May override explicitly |
| Commit | No direct authority | No direct authority | Executes after gate | Approves policy-sensitive cases |
| Push or create PR | No direct authority | No direct authority | Executes after gate | Approves in MVP |
| Merge, release, deploy | No | No | Not enabled in MVP | External/manual |

## Structured output failure

An adapter validates protocol version, type, identifiers, cardinality, text
limits, and referenced artifacts. Invalid output produces a failed attempt with
the raw response preserved. The system may request one bounded format repair,
but it never invents missing decisions, evidence, or success.

## Context assembly

Agent input is assembled from selected durable records:

- objective and current task;
- applicable project instructions;
- current plan revision and unresolved challenges;
- relevant decisions and findings;
- Git fingerprint and bounded diff summary;
- verification evidence and selected log excerpts;
- budgets, permissions, and expected response schema.

The complete historical transcript is not replayed by default. Raw transcripts
are artifacts available for inspection. Summaries carry source references so
the receiving agent can distinguish derived context from primary evidence.

## Provider runtime configuration

Host runtime preflight is intentionally narrower than provider runtime configuration, and is
itself layered into four distinct stages that must not be confused with one another:

1. **Executable discovery** — resolving a fixed candidate name to an absolute, existing path
   using only the host's normalized `PATH` and a small set of fixed fallback directories. Never a
   shell, never `PATHEXT`, never a filesystem enumeration.
2. **Launch-target validation** — for a provider whose only local discovery in Increment 2 is a
   native executable, discovery and launch-target validation coincide. Increment 4 adds one
   further, still narrowly bounded discovery path for a provider distributed as an npm package: a
   fixed, catalog-owned package-root candidate's `package.json` is read directly (strict size
   limit, strict parsing, exact expected package identity), and only its own declared `bin` entry
   is resolved, and only when that entrypoint remains beneath the package root. This never
   executes npm, npx, a package-manager shim, `.cmd`, `.bat`, cmd.exe, PowerShell, or any shell.
   More than one independently valid launch target is treated as ambiguous and fails closed —
   never chosen between silently.
3. **Version observation** — a successful direct executable version probe (or, for a validated
   npm-package launch target, a direct, fully qualified Node executable running that validated
   entrypoint) proves only that DevalCopilot observed one local runtime version at a point in
   time.
4. **Authentication/invocation readiness** — everything beyond an observed version: model
   availability, permission mode, context capacity, account usage, session continuity, and
   whether an invocation is actually eligible. These facts remain explicit `Unknown` until a
   later provider-owned adapter observes them through a reviewed contract. A future `Unsupported`
   value requires affirmative provider evidence; it is never inferred from the absence of a
   preflight probe.

A locally installed Codex desktop application's own private, versioned installation layout was
observed once, manually, through read-only inspection outside this discovery contract. That
layout is evidence that a directly executable Codex CLI can exist on a host — it is not an
approved stable discovery contract, and it is never added as an automatic fallback: it belongs to
a different application, is not catalog-owned, and carries no stability guarantee DevalCopilot
can rely on. In particular, an app-private or portable Codex desktop installation layout is never
searched for automatically at attempt-dispatch time; resolving the actual launch target for a new
Codex Planning attempt only reuses the durable `HostCapabilitySnapshot` row's resolved path from
capability discovery's own last successful probe, and only when that snapshot's reason code is
still `None` — it is revalidated, never re-searched, by this narrower dispatch-time read.

Each agent attempt is intended to eventually record requested and effective
provider configuration:

- provider and provider-session identifier;
- model and reasoning effort;
- permission mode;
- context-manifest revision;
- reported context usage and compaction outcome when available.

The Codex Planning attempt records only a subset of this today: the provider
and role are fixed by the attempt's own factory (never caller-supplied), and a
provider-session identifier is captured on a best-effort basis only when
Codex's own JSONL stdout reports one — never required, never trusted for
anything beyond this closed, cosmetic field, and not currently exposed through
any API response. Model, reasoning effort, permission mode, context usage,
and account usage are not recorded by an Agent attempt in this slice at all;
they remain `Unknown` exactly as the host-runtime-preflight projection above
already reports them, and no doc, response, or stored fact should be read as
tracking or enforcing them yet.

Adapters expose capabilities and supported values through typed queries. The
application does not assume that Codex and Claude Code use equivalent names or
offer identical controls. Unsupported or unavailable values remain explicit.

A configuration change is persisted as run intent and applies only when the
orchestrator creates the next eligible attempt. Provider permission mode cannot
expand DevalCopilot policy. Manual context compaction is a typed between-turn
operation that creates a new context-manifest revision; it never removes events,
decisions, evidence, or raw artifacts from durable history.

Provider account-usage snapshots are observation evidence rather than agent
claims. A configured hard threshold participates in attempt eligibility and
prevents a new invocation for only the affected provider.

## Token efficiency

- Build a context manifest for each attempt and include only inputs required by
  the current role and decision.
- Retrieve project documentation and source progressively instead of attaching
  the entire repository or documentation set.
- Reuse one durable summary of stable facts and link it to primary evidence;
  do not ask each agent to restate the same background.
- Send changed hunks, unresolved findings, and relevant neighboring code before
  considering a complete diff or file.
- Prefer deterministic tools for discovery, validation, counting, formatting,
  and status checks instead of spending model tokens inferring their results.
- Do not repeat an agent attempt unless state, instructions, evidence, or the
  expected response changed materially.
- Track input, output, and cached token usage when the provider exposes it.
- Stop and escalate when a stage budget is exhausted rather than silently
  borrowing unlimited tokens from the run.
- Select model capability and reasoning depth according to task risk, not as a
  universal maximum setting.

## Untrusted content

Repository files, comments, issue text, test output, CI logs, generated files,
and prior agent responses are quoted or delimited as untrusted evidence. They
cannot grant permissions, alter the protocol, request credentials, change
budgets, or bypass project instructions.

## Protocol evolution

The envelope is versioned. Additive optional fields may remain compatible.
Changing message meaning, authority, required fields, or resolution behavior
requires a protocol version and migration plan.
